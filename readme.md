# public-server

Install: `npm install https://github.com/ksiondag/public-server`

Usage: `public-server [static-directory] [port]`

Run a statically served server serving content from `static-directory`
(defaults to 'public') on given port (defaults to 8000).

## Probably-Better Alternative

This is probably inferior to
[static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server) in mostly
everyway. I just wanted a quick executable to run in browser-only prototypes.
